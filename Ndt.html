                    <p> The challenges facing NDT service companies are becoming 
                        increasingly prominent. First, these issues exist in a market made 
                        up of old, rapidly-aging infrastructure, which causes an increased 
                        demand for inspection. Second, there is a shortage of skilled 
                        labor as well as the increased departure of retiring experienced 
                        technicians, which provokes a drop in service offerings. </p><br>
    
                       <h4>SURFACE DAMAGE ASSESSMENT MODERNIZED AND ACCESSIBLE TO ALL NDT INDUSTRIES </h4><br>
