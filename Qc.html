                    <p> Quality control requires highly accurate measuring 
                        instruments. Therefore, inspections of high-tolerance 
                        features are generally assigned to traditional CMMs, 
                        whereas 3D optical measurement technologies are the 
                        preferred solutions for all other quality control applications, 
                        specifically those that occur on the shop floor. Not only are 
                        they less expensive to purchase, but they also measure 
                        faster, require less training, handling, and programming 
                        time, and save precious CMM time for critical inspections. </p><br>

                <p>VXinspect is an intuitive 3D inspection software designed for 
                    conducting first article inspection (FAI) or quality control in the 
                    manufacturing process. Directly integrated into VXelements, 
                    it provides the simplest integration of probing, 3D scanning, 
                    and photogrammetry measurements into all inspection workflows, 
                    with no compromises made on measurement quality and 
                    GD&T requirements.

            <p>VXscan-R is a reliable and accurate digital twin environment 
                useful for program preparation, scan parameter adjustment—
                speed, shutter time, and scan resolution—simulation and 
                execution. With VXscan-R’s scanning intelligence and dedicated 
                functions, programming robot paths and optimizing the line of 
                sight become easier and faster. Thanks to VXscan-R, automated 
                quality control is now accessible to non-experts—solving 
                programming issues and helping them feel confident when 
                working with robotic systems.
