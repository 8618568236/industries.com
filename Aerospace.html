                <p> Stakeholders in the aerospace industry are facing increasing pressure to ensure public safety and aircraft compliance
                     as well as prevent costly fleet groundings. </p><br>

                   <p> Creaform’s HandySCAN AEROPACKTM is the most versatile 3D 
                    scanning solution on the market for aircraft inspections, reverse 
                    engineering, maintenance and repair operations.</p><br>

                   <p> It features the metrology-grade HandySCAN 3DTM scanner as well 
                    as complete software suite to efficiently inspect and characterize 
                    defects on a variety of aircraft components, materials and finishes—
                    and in all types of work environments. The solution allows for highly 
                    accurate scans of small- to large-size parts to generate CAD models, 
                    enabling manufacturers to quickly produce spare parts.</p><br>

                    <p> Providing unmatched speed, ease of use, reliability and repeatability, 
                    HandySCAN AEROPACK makes inspection and reverse engineering 
                    workflows highly efficient, significantly reduces operators’ impact on 
                    measurement results, and shortens the time to generate final reports 
                    or CAD designs. It saves the aerospace industry time and money—all 
                    without compromising diagnosis results and safety</p>

                    <h4>HAILSTORMS</h4>
                    <p>When an aircraft hits a hailstorm, MRO teams 
                        need to rely on a solution like HandySCAN 
                        AEROPACK that enables them to quickly and 
                        accurately measure the impact to speed up 
                        repairs—and mitigate the negative ripple effects 
                        on future sales. Thanks to its remarkable 
                        versatility, operators can use the solution in any 
                        conditions, whether inside or outside, without 
                        sacrificing accuracy and reliability. </p>

                    <h4>FLAP AND SPOILER</h4>
                    <p>HandySCAN AEROPACK is the ideal solution for 
                        flap and spoiler inspections due to its ultra-fast 
                        measurements, contrary to traditional manual 
                        methods. It’s actually 80 times faster than 
                        time-consuming pit gauge techniques. In fact, 
                        operators won’t waste time searching the deepest 
                        points per dent; with the 3D scanner, they can 
                        seamlessly scan a part’s entire geometry.</p>

                    <p>When an aircraft experiences hard landings or 
                        other damaging incidents, MRO teams must use 
                        a solution that can help them analyze any type 
                        of damage on any type of surface or any type of surface texture. 
                        HandySCAN AEROPACK gives teams the thorough 
                        analyses required to inspect any component 
                        shape, size or surface finish with confidence.</p>

                    <p>Operators who are responsible to put the aircraft 
                        back into service need a tool to validate if a 
                        component is within acceptance criteria after 
                        rework is completed. Oftentimes, MRO teams 
                        don’t have access to the CAD models of aircraft 
                        components, which means reverse engineering 
                        components becomes key.  </p>

                        even the CAD files of their aircraft components.
                        It is a combined process of laser scanning the obsolete parts where engineering design has become unavailable.
